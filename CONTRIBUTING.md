### Research Extensions
- Implement new deep learning architectures
- Explore novel regularization techniques
- Develop multi-modal fusion approaches
- Create synthetic data generation methods

#### Enhanced Adaptive Fusion Framework
To further enhance the adaptive fusion framework, we propose integrating learned proposals from Mask R-CNN, such as logits or probability maps, directly into the RL action space as additional input streams for fusion. The reinforcement learning state will be enriched with image-conditioned features, CNN embeddings, and overlap statistics, providing the agent with deeper contextual awareness of both geometry and visual cues. 

Moving beyond discrete fusion weights, we will expand the action space toward continuous policies using policy-gradient methods, enabling finer-grained and more adaptive regularization decisions. Extended GPU-based training will be conducted over longer horizons with larger sample sizes, increasing the number of patches per state and incorporating a broader set of windows and states to improve stability and generalization at national scale. 

Furthermore, training Mask R-CNN for additional epochs or initializing with pre-trained weights will strengthen its role as a baseline before comparing against RL-driven fusion, ensuring more reliable benchmarking and alignment with national products such as the NLCD.

### Production Enhancements
