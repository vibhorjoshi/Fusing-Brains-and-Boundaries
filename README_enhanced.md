**Stage 2-3: Enhanced Regularization Integration (68.1% → 69.4% IoU)**
Enhanced regularizers contributed substantial improvement (+1.3% IoU) through GPU-accelerated morphological operations. The three complementary techniques (RT, RR, FER) address different geometric artifacts: RT straightens boundaries, RR removes noise while preserving rectangularity, and FER provides edge-aware filtering. This hybrid approach combines traditional computer vision reliability with modern computational efficiency.

**Stage 3-4: Reinforcement Learning Fusion (69.4% → 71.2% IoU)**
RL-based adaptive fusion delivered the largest single improvement (+1.8% IoU) by intelligently combining regularization streams. The DQN agent processes 15-dimensional feature vectors including geometric properties, texture statistics, and stream correlations to make context-aware fusion decisions. This adaptive behavior significantly outperforms fixed-weight fusion strategies.

**Stage 4-5: Continuous Action Space (71.2% → 72.6% IoU)**  
Transition to continuous actions using PPO contributed +1.4% IoU through fine-grained fusion control. The actor-critic architecture enables nuanced weight distributions rather than discrete categorical selection, achieving 28% faster convergence while improving final performance. This demonstrates the superiority of policy gradient methods for complex fusion tasks.

**Stage 5-6: CNN Contextual Features (72.6% → 73.8% IoU)**
CNN feature integration provided +1.2% IoU improvement by incorporating spatial context through convolutional embeddings. The lightweight feature extractor enables context-aware fusion based on building density, architectural styles, and landscape characteristics, significantly improving performance in heterogeneous environments.

**Stage 6-7: Pre-trained Model Benefits (73.8% → 74.4% IoU)**
COCO pre-training contributed +0.6% IoU through superior feature representations and accelerated convergence. Two-stage fine-tuning with backbone freezing/unfreezing enables effective knowledge transfer while reducing training time by 25%, demonstrating the value of large-scale dataset knowledge for specialized applications.

**Stage 7-8: Multi-State Training Robustness (74.4% → 74.9% IoU)**
Multi-state training provided the final +0.5% IoU while achieving dramatic speed improvement (70.8ms inference, 17.6× total speedup). Training across 8 diverse US states enhanced geographical robustness and generalization capabilities, ensuring consistent performance across coastal, mountainous, urban, and rural building patterns.

## Theoretical Foundations

### 1. Hybrid Regularization as Structured Priors
Traditional morphology (RT, RR, FER) introduces structured geometric priors that encode desired inductive biases for building footprints: straight edges, rectangularity, and edge preservation. Formally, posteriors p(M|X) are regularized by priors that penalize curvature and jagged boundaries. This can be viewed as adding a shape-regularization term R(M) to the segmentation objective:  
min_M  L_seg(M, X) + λ_1 R_RT(M) + λ_2 R_RR(M) + λ_3 R_FER(M),  
where RT encourages boundary straightening, RR enforces rectangular stability via opening/closing, and FER matches gradient-aligned edges. GPU implementations approximate these operators with fast, differentiable tensor ops (via convolutional stencils), preserving efficiency while imposing geometry-aware structure.

### 2. Adaptive Fusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)
The fusion problem is modeled as an MDP (S, A, P, R, γ):
- State S: concatenation of geometry descriptors (area, perimeter, compactness), overlap statistics (IoU/DSC among streams), and image-conditioned CNN embeddings.
- Action A: continuous fusion weights w ∈ Δ^K (simplex over K streams), realized via a softmax parameterization to enforce ∑_k w_k = 1, w_k ≥ 0.
- Transition P: induced by selecting weights and generating fused mask.
- Reward R: boundary-aware IoU combining region IoU with boundary IoU and negative Hausdorff distance; R = α·IoU + β·bIoU − γ·HD.
- Discount γ: near 1 to encourage stable long-horizon aggregation during training episodes.
This sequential decision framing allows context-sensitive weighting that varies across patches and local scenes, outperforming fixed-weight or heuristic fusion.

### 3. Policy Gradient with PPO for Continuous Actions
We use PPO with clipped surrogate objective:
L^CLIP(θ) = E_t[min(r_t(θ)Â_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1−ε, 1+ε)Â_t)] + c_v L_v(θ) − c_e H(π_θ),
where r_t is the probability ratio, Â_t generalized advantage estimates, L_v value loss, and H entropy bonus. Continuous actions are produced by an actor network over weights (followed by softmax), while a critic estimates V(s). PPO stabilizes updates via clipping and encourages exploration via entropy, which empirically yields better convergence and finer control than discrete DQN in fusion tasks.

### 4. Image-Conditioned State: Why CNN Features Matter
Building footprints are context-dependent (density, roof materials, shadows). CNN embeddings E(X) supply texture and context beyond mask-only features, enabling the policy to align fusion weights with local appearance. This mitigates failure modes where geometry-only states can’t disambiguate touching or low-contrast structures.

### 5. Multi-State Training and Domain Generalization
Training across diverse states approximates sampling from a broader target distribution p(X, M). This reduces covariate shift and supports domain generalization. With mixed terrains, the policy learns fusion mappings that are robust to different style/structure regimes, improving out-of-state performance and stabilizing training (lower final-epoch variance).

### 6. Computational Considerations
- Complexity: Morphology via depthwise separable kernels and batched GPU ops achieves O(N) per pixel with high constant throughput. 
- Memory: Mixed precision and tiled processing bound memory. 
- Latency: End-to-end GPU path avoids CPU-GPU ping-pong, yielding the observed 17.6× speedup.

## Overall Summary
Our hybrid, GPU-accelerated pipeline unifies learned proposals with structured geometric priors and an RL-driven continuous fusion policy. Theoretically, morphology supplies strong inductive biases; PPO-based policy gradients enable context-aware continuous weighting on the probability simplex; and multi-state training provides distributional robustness. Empirically, we achieve +7.1% IoU, +0.078 F1, and 17.6× speedup over the baseline, with earlier, more stable convergence. The approach scales to large geographies (326 patches/min) and maintains accuracy across diverse terrains. These results demonstrate that principled fusion of classical priors and modern learning—implemented efficiently on GPUs—delivers state-of-the-art building footprint extraction with real-world deployability.

# Install dependencies (once)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the live demo
python demo_citywise_live.py
```

Outputs saved under `outputs/citywise_live/`:
- `<City>_input.png`: fetched input image
- `<City>_overlay_baseline.png`: baseline mask overlay
- `<City>_overlay_fused.png`: RL-fused mask overlay
- `<City>_overlay_lapnet.png`: LapNet-refined overlay (if available)
- `<City>_summary.csv`: run metadata (samples used, reward summary)
