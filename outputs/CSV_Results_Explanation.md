## Usage Instructions

### Data Analysis
```python
import pandas as pd
results = pd.read_csv('stepwise_performance_results.csv')

# Calculate improvement rates
results['IoU_Improvement'] = results['IoU (%)'].diff()
results['Speed_Ratio'] = results['Inference Time (ms)'].iloc[0] / results['Inference Time (ms)']

# Visualize progress
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(results.index, results['IoU (%)'])
plt.title('IoU Improvement Progression')
plt.xlabel('Enhancement Stage')
plt.ylabel('IoU Percentage')
```
