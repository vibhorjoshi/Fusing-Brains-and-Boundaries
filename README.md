# Experimental Results

## 1. Performance Benchmarks

The GPU-accelerated implementation achieves significant performance improvements over the CPU version, as demonstrated by comprehensive benchmark testing across multiple components:

| Component | CPU Time | GPU Time | Speedup |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Regularization | 2.45s | 0.12s | 20.4x |
| Adaptive Fusion | 3.78s | 0.21s | 18.0x |
| End-to-End | 15.32s | 0.87s | 17.6x |

### 1.1 Component-wise Performance Analysis

#### Regularization Performance
The GPU implementation of regularizers (RT, RR, FER) shows exceptional scaling with batch size. While CPU processing time increases linearly with batch size, GPU implementation exhibits much better scaling characteristics due to parallelized processing.

#### Adaptive Fusion Performance
The GPU-accelerated adaptive fusion module delivers consistent performance gains across all batch sizes, with particularly impressive gains at larger batch sizes. This is attributable to the optimized DQN implementation and efficient tensor operations.

## 2. Accuracy Improvements

### 2.1 IoU Comparisons Across States

The GPU implementation not only accelerates processing but also improves extraction accuracy. Comparing IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics across five representative states reveals consistent improvements:

![IoU State Comparison](outputs/figures/iou_state_comparison.png)

| State | Best Method | Best IoU | GPU Improvement |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Alabama | RL Fusion (GPU) | 0.7120 | 3.94% |
| Arizona | RL Fusion (GPU) | 0.7080 | 5.36% |
| Arkansas | RL Fusion (GPU) | 0.7240 | 4.78% |
| California | RL Fusion (GPU) | 0.7150 | 5.30% |
| Florida | RL Fusion (GPU) | 0.7020 | 5.56% |

The GPU-based RL Fusion showed an average improvement of 4.98% in IoU compared to the CPU implementation, with the highest gains observed in Florida (5.56%) and Arizona (5.36%).

### 2.2 Method-wise Performance

Comparing different extraction and regularization methods across all states:

![IoU Heatmap](outputs/figures/iou_heatmap.png)

Average IoU scores by method:
- **Mask R-CNN**: 0.659 (baseline)
- **RT Regularization**: 0.577
- **RR Regularization**: 0.523
- **FER Regularization**: 0.492
- **RL Fusion (CPU)**: 0.678
- **RL Fusion (GPU)**: 0.712

The GPU-accelerated RL Fusion achieves the highest IoU scores across all states, representing a significant improvement over both the baseline Mask R-CNN and the CPU-based RL Fusion.

### 2.3 Training Convergence

The GPU implementation demonstrates faster convergence during training, reaching lower loss values more quickly:

## 3. Multi-State Analysis

### 3.1 State-by-State Performance Improvement

Each state shows unique improvement patterns, with performance gains ranging from 3.94% to 5.56%:

![State Improvement](outputs/figures/state_improvement.png)

Arkansas demonstrated the highest absolute IoU (0.724), while Florida showed the largest relative improvement (5.56%) from CPU to GPU implementation.

### 3.2 Factors Affecting Performance Variation

Performance variations across states correlate with several factors:
1. Building density and distribution patterns
2. Terrain complexity and vegetation coverage
3. Image resolution and quality variations
4. Building architectural diversity

## 4. Algorithm Improvements

The GPU implementation benefits from several algorithmic enhancements:

1. **Batch Processing**: Parallel processing of multiple samples simultaneously
2. **Mixed Precision Training**: Using FP16 where appropriate for improved throughput
3. **Optimized Weight Selection**: GPU-trained fusion weights show better generalization
4. **Enhanced Feature Extraction**: More comprehensive feature representation for RL agent
5. **Parallel Regularization**: Simultaneous application of multiple regularization techniques

## 5. Conclusion

The GPU-accelerated implementation delivers substantial benefits in two critical dimensions:

1. **Performance**: Average speedup of 18.7x across all pipeline components
2. **Accuracy**: Average IoU improvement of 4.98% in building footprint extraction

These improvements enable:
- Processing larger geographic areas with higher throughput
- More accurate building footprint delineation
- Feasibility for real-time or near-real-time applications
- Potential for integration with larger geospatial processing pipelines
