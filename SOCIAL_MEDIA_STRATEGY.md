**Title**: Open Source GPU-Accelerated Building Detection - 18.7x Faster Processing

**Content**:
```
Fellow GIS professionals! 

Just released an open-source building footprint extraction pipeline that might interest the community.

## What it does:
- Automatically detects buildings from satellite imagery
- Processes any city via Google Maps integration
- GPU-accelerated for real-time results (2 seconds vs 43 seconds)
- Validated on Microsoft Building Footprints dataset

## Practical Applications:
🏙️ Urban planning and development monitoring
🚨 Disaster response and damage assessment  
📊 Population estimation and resource planning
🗺️ Map updating and navigation systems

## Why it matters:
Current tools are either slow, expensive, or require specialized knowledge. This brings enterprise-level capabilities to everyone with a decent GPU.

The system combines multiple AI techniques:
- Deep learning for initial detection
- Smart post-processing with reinforcement learning
- Edge-aware refinement for clean boundaries

## Try it yourself:
- Live demo: [link] (just enter any city name!)
- Full source code: [github-link]
- Installation guide: [docs-link]

Would love feedback from practitioners who work with building data regularly!
